## Proposal
**Title: Developing an App/Website for Teachers to Record Tasks, Reminders, Calendar and Communication for Specific Departments**

**Introduction:** At Sacred Heart College, communication, task planning and ensuring tasks are done punctually is essential to keep the classrooms and school running smoothly. However, teachers at Sacred Heart College get very busy and can become overwhelmed with tasks and things to remember which will make these essential aspects a challenging task. In this project, I propose to develop an app/website for teachers to record tasks, reminders, calendar and communication for specific departments.

**Objective:** The main objective of this project is to develop an app/website for teachers to record tasks, reminders, calendar and communication for specific departments. The app will take into account factors such as target audience demographics, clients and stakeholders (teachers)’s current problems with the tools used presently, and my own abilities when planning, coding and researching. 

**Methodology:** 

The project will be divided into the following phases: 

**1. Data Collection:** Collect information on features that various teachers might need that they may be having an issue with the resources that they use currently.

**2. Data Analysis:** Analyse the collected information to identify any trends of issues that different teachers are facing.

**3. App Development:** Develop an app/website for teachers to record tasks, reminders, calendar and communication for specific departments. The app will take into account various factors such as target audience demographics, clients and stakeholders (teachers)’s current problems with the tools used presently, and my own abilities when planning, coding and researching.  

**4. App Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the developed app using real time feedback from clients and stakeholders, including advice from Mr Ganess and external professionals.

**5. Implementation:** Implement the developed app as a software tool that can be used by teachers at Sacred Heart College to optimise teaching abilities by staying on top of their tasks and having better communication with colleagues.

**Expected outcomes: **
The expected outcomes of this project are: 

* An efficient app for optimising teaching abilities by staying on top of their tasks and having better communication with colleagues.

* A software tool that can be used by teachers to complement efficient task management and communication


**Conclusion:** This project has the potential to make an impact on the teachers at Sacred Heart College by providing them with a tool that can help them maximise their efficiency when planning tasks, communicating and reminders. The developed app can also be extended to other areas by making it available to a wider range of people, such as students to use with their own classes.
