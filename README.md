**This repository** outlines a project to develop an app/website for teachers at Sacred Heart College to record tasks, reminders, calendar, and communication for specific departments. The project will involve data collection and analysis, app development, app evaluation, and implementation. The expected outcomes include an efficient app for optimizing teaching abilities, a software tool for complementing efficient task management and communication, and the potential for extension to other areas. The proposal emphasizes the need for the app to take into account factors such as target audience demographics, current problems with existing tools, and the developer's own abilities when planning, coding, and researching.
